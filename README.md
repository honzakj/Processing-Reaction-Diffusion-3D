# Reaction Diffusion 3D_Processing

### Simple true 3D reaction diffusion implementation made in Processing 4.0.1.

Sketch includes possibility to export simulation results as a csv file so that you can use it in another software
<br> <br>
Note that 3D simulations are computationally heavy. 
On my computer the simulation stabilizes after 10-15 minutes (100x100x100 points).
